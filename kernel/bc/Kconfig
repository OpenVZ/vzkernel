config BEANCOUNTERS
	bool "Enable user resource accounting"
	default y
	help 
          This patch provides accounting and allows to configure
          limits for user's consumption of exhaustible system resources.
          The most important resource controlled by this patch is unswappable 
          memory (either mlock'ed or used by internal kernel structures and 
          buffers). The main goal of this patch is to protect processes
          from running short of important resources because of an accidental
          misbehavior of processes or malicious activity aiming to ``kill'' 
          the system. It's worth to mention that resource limits configured 
          by setrlimit(2) do not give an acceptable level of protection 
          because they cover only small fraction of resources and work on a 
          per-process basis.  Per-process accounting doesn't prevent malicious
          users from spawning a lot of resource-consuming processes.

	select MEMCG_KMEM
	select MEMCG_SWAP if SWAP
	select MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED if SWAP
	select CGROUP_HUGETLB if HUGETLBFS
	help
          This allows to estimate per beancounter physical memory usage.
          Implemented alghorithm accounts shared pages of memory as well,
          dividing them by number of beancounter which use the page.

config BC_IO_ACCOUNTING
	bool "Account file I/O"
	default y
	depends on BEANCOUNTERS
	help
	  This option allows seeing I/O activity caused by tasks from each UB

config BC_IO_PRIORITY
	bool "Disk I/O priority"
	default y
	depends on BEANCOUNTERS
	select BLK_CGROUP
	help
	  This option add compat-layer on top of the blkio-cgroup for groupping
	  and prioritizing disk access.

config BC_PROC
	bool "Report resource usage in /proc"
	default y
	depends on BEANCOUNTERS
	help
          Allows a system administrator to inspect resource accounts and limits.

config BC_DEBUG
	bool "User resources debug features"
	default y
	depends on BEANCOUNTERS
	help
	  Enables to setup debug features for user resource accounting

config BC_DEBUG_KMEM
	bool "Debug kmemsize with cache counters"
	default n
	depends on BC_DEBUG
	help
	  Adds /proc/user_beancounters_debug entry to get statistics
	  about cache usage of each beancounter

config BC_KEEP_UNUSED
	bool "Keep unused beancounter alive"
	default n
	depends on BC_DEBUG
	help
	  If on, unused beancounters are kept on the hash and maxheld value
	  can be looked through.

config BC_DEBUG_ITEMS
	bool "Account resources in items rather than in bytes"
	default n
	depends on BC_DEBUG
	help
	  When true some of the resources (e.g. kmemsize) are accounted
	  in items instead of bytes.

config BC_UNLIMITED
	bool "Use unlimited ubc settings"
	default n
	depends on BC_DEBUG
	help
	  When ON all limits and barriers are set to max values.
