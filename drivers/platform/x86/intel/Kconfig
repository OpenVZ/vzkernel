	  Say Y here to get to see options for device drivers for
	  various Intel x86 platforms, including vendor-specific
	  drivers. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped
	  and disabled.

	  This driver enables access to the Intel Software Defined Silicon
	  interface used to provision silicon features with an authentication
	  certificate and capability license.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called intel_sdsi.

	  Adds support for feature drivers exposed using Intel PCIe VSEC and
	  DVSEC.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called intel_vsec.

       help
         This driver is for accessing the PSE (Programmable Service Engine) -
         an Embedded Controller like IP - using ISHTP (Integrated Sensor Hub
         Transport Protocol) to get battery, thermal and UCSI (USB Type-C
         Connector System Software Interface) related data from the platform.
         Users who don't want to use discrete Embedded Controller on Intel's
         Elkhartlake platform can leverage this integrated solution of
         ECLite which is part of PSE subsystem.

         To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
         will be called intel_ishtp_eclite.
