	  Say Y here to get to see options for device drivers for
	  various Intel x86 platforms, including vendor-specific
	  drivers. This option alone does not add any kernel code.

	  If you say N, all options in this submenu will be skipped
	  and disabled.

	help
	  This driver provides support for the Intel HID Event hotkey interface.
	  Some laptops require this driver for hotkey support.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called intel_hid.

	depends on X86_64
	help
	  This driver enables access to the Intel On Demand (formerly Software
	  Defined Silicon) interface used to provision silicon features with an
	  authentication certificate and capability license.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called intel_sdsi.

	help
	  The Intel Topology Aware Register and PM Capsule Interface (TPMI),
	  provides enumerable MMIO interface for power management features.
	  This driver creates devices, so that other PM feature driver can
	  be loaded for PM specific feature operation.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called intel_vsec_tpmi.


config INTEL_VSEC
	tristate "Intel Vendor Specific Extended Capabilities Driver"
	depends on PCI
	select AUXILIARY_BUS
	help
	  Adds support for feature drivers exposed using Intel PCIe VSEC and
	  DVSEC.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called intel_vsec.

config INTEL_ISHTP_ECLITE

       depends on ACPI
       help
         This driver is for accessing the PSE (Programmable Service Engine) -
         an Embedded Controller like IP - using ISHTP (Integrated Sensor Hub
         Transport Protocol) to get battery, thermal and UCSI (USB Type-C
         Connector System Software Interface) related data from the platform.
         Users who don't want to use discrete Embedded Controller on Intel's
         Elkhartlake platform can leverage this integrated solution of
         ECLite which is part of PSE subsystem.

         To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
         will be called intel_ishtp_eclite.
