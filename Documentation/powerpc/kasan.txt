32 bit support
==============

KASAN is supported on both hash and nohash MMUs on 32-bit.

The shadow area sits at the top of the kernel virtual memory space above the
fixmap area and occupies one eighth of the total kernel virtual memory space.

Instrumentation of the vmalloc area is optional, unless built with modules,
in which case it is required.
