Description:	Reports the current configuration of the QAT device and allows
		to change it.

		This attribute is RW.

		Returned values:
			sym;asym:	the device is configured for running
					crypto services
			dc:		the device is configured for running
					compression services

		Allowed values:
			sym;asym:	configure the device for running
					crypto services
			dc:		configure the device for running
					compression services

		It is possible to set the configuration only if the device
		is in the `down` state (see /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state)

		The following example shows how to change the configuration of
		a device configured for running crypto services in order to
		run data compression:
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			up
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			sym;asym
			# echo down > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# echo dc > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			# echo up > /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/state
			# cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/qat/cfg_services
			dc

		This attribute is only available for qat_4xxx devices.
