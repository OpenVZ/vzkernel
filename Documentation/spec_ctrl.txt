== How to detect if the CPU supports Speculation Control ==

When the first CPU boots or after a microcode update, if the CPU has
speculation control capabilities these lines are printed:

	FEATURE SPEC_CTRL Present
	FEATURE IBPB_SUPPORT Present

If speculation control is missing these lines are printed:

	FEATURE SPEC_CTRL Not Present
	FEATURE IBPB_SUPPORT Not Present

Some CPUs only have IBPB_SUPPORT in which case this will be printed:

	FEATURE SPEC_CTRL Not Present
	FEATURE IBPB_SUPPORT Present

Some CPUs can only disable IBP but have no IBRS/IBPB support in which case
these lines are printed and a special use_ibp_disable mode is
used.

	FEATURE SPEC_CTRL Present (Implicit)
	FEATURE IBPB_SUPPORT Present (Implicit)

== How to tune Speculation Control ==

The current spectre_v2 mitigation status can be determined by reading
the following file:

  /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2

That file provides a basic status -- "Vulnerable" or "Mitigation" --
along with a short description of the mitigation in use (or lack
thereof).

Speculation control may be tuned from the kernel command line with the
spectre_v2= parameter.  For the available options, see
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt.

It may also be tuned from debugfs.  There are two main control knobs:

  /sys/kernel/debug/x86/retp_enabled
  /sys/kernel/debug/x86/ibrs_enabled

There is also a read-only informational debugfs entry:

  /sys/kernel/debug/x86/ibpb_enabled (read-only)

If both of the above microcode features aren't present, ibrs_enabled and
ibpb_enabled are both set to 0, and ibrs_enabled cannot be changed.

If both of the above features are present, the ibrs_enabled and
ibpb_enabled show the current kernel usage of the respective feature.

If, on an AMD processor, IBPB_SUPPORT is present, but SPEC_CTRL is not
present, ibrs_enabled will be read-only at 0, and ibpb_enabled will be
either 0 or 1, dependent on whether retpolines are enabled.

When IBRS is enabled, it means IBP (Indirect Branch Prediction)
restricted speculation and it slows down the CPU significantly,
particularly on pre-Skylake CPUs.  This is why pre-Skylake CPUs default
to using retpolines instead of IBRS.

retp_enabled 0: Disabled

retp_enabled 1: Retpolines are enabled in the kernel, which replace all
		indirect jumps and indirect calls with a special
		instruction sequence which avoids the use of IBP.

		This is the default mode on all CPUs except for Intel
		Skylake+ and AMD 10h/12h.

		This mitigation doesn't directly depend on any microcode
		features.  However, it's only considered a partial
		solution without the IBPB_SUPPORT microcode feature
		which adds user-to-user and guest-to-guest protection
		across context switches.

ibrs_enabled 0: Disabled

ibrs_enabled 1: IBRS enabled in kernel mode.

		Kernel is protected from userland and guest
                mode. Userland is not protected from guest mode. User
                mode isn't protected from other user mode running in a
                sibling hyperthread.

		This is the default mode on Skylake and newer CPUs.  It
		cannot be used with retp_enabled 1.

		requires SPEC_CTRL present

ibrs_enabled 2: IBRS enabled in user mode and kernel mode. Only guest
	        can disable IBRS.

		Kernel and usermode are both protected. This protects
		userland from hyperthreading effects and from guest
		mode too.

		This option cannot be used with retp_enabled 1

		This is the default mode on AMD 10h and AMD 12h
		families, which have the ability to completely disable
		the indirect branch predictor.  They don't actually have
		IBRS or IBPB, but the effect is the same.

		requires SPEC_CTRL present

ibrs_enabled 3: IBRS enabled in user mode.

		Userland is protected from guest mode and from
		hyperthreading effects.  This option can *only* be used
		in combination with retp_enabled 1, with retpolines
		protecting the kernel and IBRS protecting userland.

		requires SPEC_CTRL present

ibpb_enabled 0: Disabled

ibpb_enabled 1: IBPB IBP barrier is used to flush the IBP across mm
                switches (if next task has not enough credentials to
                read the memory of the prev task by other means) and
                across guest mode switches. This protects user and
                guest mode against user and guest mode.

		This doesn't protect against hyperthreading and
                simultaneous multithreading effects.

		This option is read-only.  It is automatically selected
		when retp_enabled is 1 or ibrs_enabled is 1, 2, or 3.

		requires IBPB_SUPPORT present
