 * A callback you can register to apply pressure to ageable caches.
 *
 * @shrink() should look through the least-recently-used 'nr_to_scan' entries
 * and attempt to free them up.  It should return the number of objects which
 * remain in the cache.  If it returns -1, it means it cannot do any scanning at
 * this time (eg. there is a risk of deadlock).
 *
 * @count_objects should return the number of freeable items in the cache. If
 * there are no objects to free or the number of freeable items cannot be
 * determined, it should return 0. No deadlock checks should be done during the
 * count callback - the shrinker relies on aggregating scan counts that couldn't
 * be executed due to potential deadlocks to be run at a later call when the
 * deadlock condition is no longer pending.
 *
 * @scan_objects will only be called if @count_objects returned a non-zero
 * value for the number of freeable objects. The callout should scan the cache
 * and attempt to free items from the cache. It should then return the number
 * of objects freed during the scan, or SHRINK_STOP if progress cannot be made
 * due to potential deadlocks. If SHRINK_STOP is returned, then no further
 * attempts to call the @scan_objects will be made from the current reclaim
 * context.
 *
 * @flags determine the shrinker abilities, like numa awareness
