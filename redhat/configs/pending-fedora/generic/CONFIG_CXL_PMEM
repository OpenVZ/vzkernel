# CONFIG_CXL_PMEM:
# 
# In addition to typical memory resources a platform may also advertise
# support for persistent memory attached via CXL. This support is
# managed via a bridge driver from CXL to the LIBNVDIMM system
# subsystem. Say 'y/m' to enable support for enumerating and
# provisioning the persistent memory capacity of CXL memory expanders.
# 
# If unsure say 'm'.
