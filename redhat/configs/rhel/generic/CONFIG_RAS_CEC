# This option allows systems with ECC memory to perform Predictive Failure
# Analysis (PFA) using CE MCE data to determine when an 4K page of memory
# should be taken out of service and then remapped to another region of
# memory.  This feature conflicts with many server systems which have their
# own HW or SW-assisted PFA and should be disabled.
