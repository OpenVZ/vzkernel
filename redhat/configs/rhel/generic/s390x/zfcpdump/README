Place config options in this directory that you want applied to the
s390x-zfcpdump kernel variant only. These options are overlayed atop the
generic/ and generic/s390x/ kernel options.

The s390x-zfcpdump kernel variant is used as separate kernel for the SCSI
stand-alone dump (also known as zfcp dump) on s390.

A separate kernel is needed for the hardware dump mechanism as there's
a fixed 32MB limitation (64MB on some new machines) on the size of the
kernel the hardware is able to load -- hence the need for this minimal
configuration. This kernel variant only needs to write to FCP-attached
SCSI disks. Therefore networking support, for instance, is not needed.
