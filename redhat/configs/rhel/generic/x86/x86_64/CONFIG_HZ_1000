# HZ=1000 is inherited from Fedora/RHEL7. Also we use this value
# to avoid TCP issues as explained by David Miller:
# "When the system is busy, a system with NO_HZ + HZ=1000 processes it's timer
#  workload more smoothly.
#
#  With a lower value of HZ such as 250 or 100, lots of timer events get
#  "bunched up" due to the lower granularity and thus the timers are
#  processed in a very bursty fashion.
#
#  This hurts TCP with lots of connections on the system."
CONFIG_HZ_1000=y
