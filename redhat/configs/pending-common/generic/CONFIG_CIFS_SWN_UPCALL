# CONFIG_CIFS_SWN_UPCALL:
# 
# The Service Witness Protocol (SWN) is used to get notifications
# from a highly available server of resource state changes. This
# feature enables an upcall mechanism for CIFS which contacts a
# userspace daemon to establish the DCE/RPC connection to retrieve
# the cluster available interfaces and resource change notifications.
# If unsure, say Y.
# 
# Symbol: CIFS_SWN_UPCALL [=n]
