# CONFIG_PPC_QUEUED_SPINLOCKS:
# 
# Say Y here to use queued spinlocks which give better scalability and
# fairness on large SMP and NUMA systems without harming single threaded
# performance.
# 
# This option is currently experimental, the code is more complex and
# less tested so it defaults to "N" for the moment.
# 
# If unsure, say "N".
# 
# Symbol: PPC_QUEUED_SPINLOCKS [=n]
# Type  : bool
