# CONFIG_CORESIGHT_TRBE:
# 
# This driver provides support for percpu Trace Buffer Extension (TRBE).
# TRBE always needs to be used along with it's corresponding percpu ETE
# component. ETE generates trace data which is then captured with TRBE.
# Unlike traditional sink devices, TRBE is a CPU feature accessible via
# system registers. But it's explicit dependency with trace unit (ETE)
# requires it to be plugged in as a coresight sink device.
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
# called coresight-trbe.
