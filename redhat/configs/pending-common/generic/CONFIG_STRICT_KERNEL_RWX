# CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX:
# 
# If this is set, kernel text and rodata memory will be made read-only,
# and non-text memory will be made non-executable. This provides
# protection against certain security exploits (e.g. executing the heap
# or modifying text)
# 
# These features are considered standard security practice these days.
# You should say Y here in almost all cases.
