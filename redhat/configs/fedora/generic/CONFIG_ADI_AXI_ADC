# CONFIG_ADI_AXI_ADC:
# 
# Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices Generic
# AXI ADC IP core. The IP core is used for interfacing with
# analog-to-digital (ADC) converters that require either a high-speed
# serial interface (JESD204B/C) or a source synchronous parallel
# interface (LVDS/CMOS).
# Typically (for such devices) SPI will be used for configuration only,
# while this IP core handles the streaming of data into memory via DMA.
#

# If unsure, say N (but it's safe to say "Y").
# 
# To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
# module will be called adi-axi-adc.
