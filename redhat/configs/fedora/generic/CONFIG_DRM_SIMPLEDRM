# CONFIG_DRM_SIMPLEDRM:
# 
# DRM driver for simple platform-provided framebuffers.
# 
# This driver assumes that the display hardware has been initialized
# by the firmware or bootloader before the kernel boots. Scanout
# buffer, size, and display format must be provided via device tree,
# UEFI, VESA, etc.
# 
# On x86 and compatible, you should also select CONFIG_X86_SYSFB to
# use UEFI and VESA framebuffers.
