# The branch used as upstream. This is what the upstream tarball is it
# should be tracked in a local branch. This would be "master" for the

# If VERSION_ON_UPSTREAM is set, the versioning of the rpm package is based
# on a branch tracking upstream. This allows for generating rpms
# based on untagged releases.

# BUMP_RELEASE determines whether the pkgrelease is bumped when you call
# 'make dist-release'.  It should be set to "yes" if you expect to do
# multiple updates and builds without bumping the base version, and no
# when you expect every build to use a different base kernel version.

# Should DIST tag be present also in source tags and commits? For ARK
# it should be '0' since rpms may be re-build in multiple buildroots.
# Downstream releases with single buildroot are expected to use '1'
# which makes produced rpms match source tags, changelog, etc. including
# dist tag.

# INCLUDE_*_FILES determines whether or not the specific OS flavor files will
# be included as part of the source RPM.  Downstream projects, such as
# centos-stream or RHEL, can disable file inclusion by setting these values
# to '0'.
