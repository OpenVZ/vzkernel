# The branch used as upstream. This is what the upstream tarball is it
# should be tracked in a local branch. This would be "master" for the

# any other upstream you have added as a branch locally.

# If VERSION_ON_UPSTREAM is set, the versioning of the rpm package is based
# on a branch tracking upstream. This allows for generating rpms
# based on untagged releases.

# RELEASED_KERNEL swaps between the pre-release secureboot keys and
# the release one, for vmlinux signing. It also controls whether Fedora
# kernels are built as debug kernels or release kernels with a separate
# kernel-debug build.
# Set RELEASED_KERNEL to 1 when the upstream source tarball contains a
#  kernel release. (This includes prepatch or "rc" releases.)
# Set RELEASED_KERNEL to 0 when the upstream source tarball contains an
#  unreleased kernel development snapshot.
RELEASED_KERNEL:=0

# BUMP_RELEASE determines whether the pkgrelease is bumped when you call
# 'make dist-release'.  It should be set to "yes" if you expect to do
# multiple updates and builds without bumping the base version, and no
# when you expect every build to use a different base kernel version.
BUMP_RELEASE:=yes
