#
# This script is intended to regularly update the $BRANCH branch with the latest
# configuration options from upstream. It merges the given reference into
# $BRANCH, adds all new configuration symbols to the pending/ config directory,
# and creates a branch for each new config group.
#
# If the upstream branch fails to merge and the REPORT_BUGS environment variable
# is set, an issue is filed against the provided project ID.
#
# Arguments:
#   1) The git object to merge into $BRANCH. This should be something from
#	Linus's master branch, usually either a tag such as v5.5-rc3 or just
#	linus/master. The default is "master".
#   2) The Gitlab project ID to file issues against. See the project page on
#	Gitlab for the ID. For example, https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-ark/
#	is project ID 13604247. The default is "13604247".

To resolve this, do the following:

1. git checkout os-build
2. git merge master
3. Use your soft, squishy brain to resolve the conflict as you see fit.
4. git push
