#This Makefile is here for the sole purpose of building an SRPM
#within the brew/koji build environment
#
#When Brew launches a build with a commit on the end of the brew uri,
#it runs the BuildSRPMFromSCM task first, which clones the requested
#git tree, resets to the requested commit, cd's to the directory, and runs
#'make sources'.  That make target is responsible for creating an SRPM
#that the next brew task will then build.
#
#Other targets in this makefile
#
#notes: Responsible for pulling any note branches down from the origin
#
#buildid: This sets the BUILDID varible, which allows a brew scratch build
#	  To have a unique buildid as set by the developer.
#	  set it with - git notes --ref buildid -m ".buildid" HEAD
