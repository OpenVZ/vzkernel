summary: The Bugzilla/Kernel lifecycle

{{< toc >}}

For every modification against the RHEL kernel, an approved https://bugzilla.redhat.com[Bugzilla] (or BZ) is required for that change to make it into the release.  This document provides an overview of a modification to the RHEL kernel from the perspective of the BZ and how it evolves through the journey.

The status journey on a BZ can be any one of the following values.  Note that there are additional status settings, but they are not generally used.  

It is not explicitly required that this process is followed in 100% order.  Meaning, that a bugfix may be prepared ahead of the BZ being ready, but the overall process cannot be completed until each of the detailed steps below are completed and satisfied.

For guidance around the overall xref:rhel_kernel_workflow.adoc[Kernel Workflow] process, please visit the xref:readme.adoc[Quick Start Guide].

== Step 1. BZ Opened

[frame=none, grid=none]

// Is there a way to make this cleaner?  Seems like it all has to be on a single line, which is hard to read.
a| image::images/colored-NEW.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ASSIGNED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-POST.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-MODIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ON_QA.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-VERIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-CLOSED.png["All Status"]

|===

As with every process, it must begin somewhere.  For Bugzilla and the Kernel Workflow process, this status ends up being `NEW`.  This indicates that the BZ is just that, new.  It has not been reviewed, triaged, or considered for fixing or addressing yet.

BZ's that are in this state will be periodically reviewed by their current default assignee, which is determined by the component and sub-component that was chosen.  A BZ may be transferred between multiple components and sub-components until the appropriate destination has been determined.

Every team has their own review process, but common to them all is that once a BZ has been triaged, it will then be moved to `ASSIGNED` to an individual to review and evaluate the BZ.  As part of the triage process, a BZ can also just move directly to the `CLOSED` status if it is not appropriate to keep open.  Reasons could be that the BZ has already been addressed (and therefore would be `CLOSED` -> `DUPLICATE`) or maybe it's something else (e.g. user error).

== Step 2. BZ Triaged and Scheduled

// Is there a way to make this cleaner?  Seems like it all has to be on a single line, which is hard to read.
a| image::images/clear-NEW.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-ASSIGNED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-POST.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-MODIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ON_QA.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-VERIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-CLOSED.png["All Status"]

|===

Once a BZ has been triaged and `ASSIGNED` to an individual, they will review the details of it and identify what needs to be done.  Assuming a change is required, the BZ will then be scheduled for a particular release, which requires setting a number of internal-only visible fields such as Development Target Milestone, Internal Target Milestone, and Internal Target Release.

In the most basic scenario (before ITM 26, and not for a Z-Stream), a BZ is approved once the `release+` flag is granted.  For more information, visit the xref:readme.adoc#getreleaseapproval[Get Release Approval] section in the xref:readme.adoc[Quick Start Guide].

== Step 3. Change Prepared

// Is there a way to make this cleaner?  Seems like it all has to be on a single line, which is hard to read.
a| image::images/clear-NEW.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ASSIGNED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-POST.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-MODIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ON_QA.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-VERIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-CLOSED.png["All Status"]

|===

Once a change has been prepared for the kernel, it needs to be made available for review.  To indicate that the update is ready to be looked at, the state of the BZ should be changed to `POST`.  Almost along the lines of it being `POST`-ed to a bulletin board for people to see.  This step will be automatically completed by the webhooks once the BZ has been detected in the description.

For the RHEL Kernel Workflow process, the update is provided via the GitLab Merge Request interface.

== Step 4. MR / GitLab Process

[frame=none, grid=none]
|===

// Is there a way to make this cleaner?  Seems like it all has to be on a single line, which is hard to read.
a| image::images/clear-NEW.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ASSIGNED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-POST.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-MODIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ON_QA.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-VERIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-CLOSED.png["All Status"]

|===

All changes to the RHEL kernel are done via the GitLab Merge Request interface.  For more detailed information about this process, please visit the xref:readme.adoc[Quick Start Guide].  As soon as the web hooks in the GitLab infrastructure notices a referenced BZ in the description, a link will be added to the BZ pointing at the relevant Merge Request(s).

The loose process, however, looks like this:

. Tag all commits in the Merge Request as specified in the xref:commitrules.adoc[Commit Rules] document.
. Open MR.
. Obtain at least 2 reviews and reviews from the affected https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/src/kernel/documentation/-/blob/main/info/owners.yaml[code owners].
. Verify the Continuous Kernel Integration (CKI) test has run and completed successfully.
. Once all but the Bugzilla check labels receives the `::OK` status, the `readyForQA` label will be applied.
.. This would include checks such as `Acks`, `Dependencies`, `Signoff`, etc.
. Work with QE to properly set Verified field in BZ to `Tested`.
. Upon the time where the MR receives the `::OK` status on *all* labels, the `readyForQA` label is removed and `readyForMerge` label is applied.
. Kernel Maintainer pulls in the Merge Request once the `readyForMerge` label has been obtained.

== Step 5. QE Verifies the fix

// Is there a way to make this cleaner?  Seems like it all has to be on a single line, which is hard to read.
a| image::images/clear-NEW.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ASSIGNED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-POST.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-MODIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ON_QA.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-VERIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-CLOSED.png["All Status"]

|===

Once the Merge Request has received sufficient reviews and the CKI test has passed, the `readyForQA` label will be applied to it.  It is at this point that the BZ status will be moved from POST to `MODIFIED`.  The assigned QE engineer will verify that the change does what was intended.  This is typically done by using the reproduction steps that were noted in the BZ's description field when it was originally opened.  From there, the QE Engineer will set the Verified Field to `Tested`.

== Step 6. Maintainers stage for the next build.

// Is there a way to make this cleaner?  Seems like it all has to be on a single line, which is hard to read.
a| image::images/clear-NEW.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ASSIGNED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-POST.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-MODIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ON_QA.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-VERIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-CLOSED.png["All Status"]

|===

After the BZ's Verified field is updated to `Tested` (or equivalent), the Merge Request should now have the `readyForMerge` label applied to it.  This is the signal to the Kernel Maintainer that the merge request is ready to be pulled into a delivery candidate kernel build.  When the update does get pulled in, the affected BZ statuses will be updated to `MODIFIED`.

== Step 7. New kernel is available

[frame=none, grid=none]
|===

// Is there a way to make this cleaner?  Seems like it all has to be on a single line, which is hard to read.
a| image::images/clear-NEW.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ASSIGNED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-POST.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-MODIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-ON_QA.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-VERIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-CLOSED.png["All Status"]

|===

The maintainers assemble a new kernel periodically to deliver the various updates that they were provided.  The schedule on this can vary, but when times are busy enough it's not uncommon to see a new kernel at least once per week.  As part of this process, the kernel undergoes its own set of CKI tests just like every other Merge Request.  Once the new kernel has gotten past the gating phase, it is tagged in the infrastructure to be used in the next upcoming composes.  It is at this point that the BZ will transition from `MODIFIED` to `ON_QA` by adding it to an existing errata advisory.

== Step 8. QE Performs Final Verification

[frame=none, grid=none]
|===

// Is there a way to make this cleaner?  Seems like it all has to be on a single line, which is hard to read.
a| image::images/clear-NEW.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ASSIGNED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-POST.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-MODIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-ON_QA.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-VERIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-CLOSED.png["All Status"]

|===

Just like in previous steps, when the BZ reaches the `ON_QA` status, it is a signal to QE that they can perform final verification of the BZ based on the description steps that were provided.A  If everything checks out, the QE engineer will mark the BZ as `VERIFIED`.  The BZ will remain in this state until it is released with an update for RHEL.

== Step 9. BZ Update is delivered with a release and finally the BZ is Closed

[frame=none, grid=none]
|===

// Is there a way to make this cleaner?  Seems like it all has to be on a single line, which is hard to read.
a| image::images/clear-NEW.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ASSIGNED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-POST.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-MODIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-ON_QA.png["All Status"] a| image::images/clear-VERIFIED.png["All Status"] a| image::images/colored-CLOSED.png["All Status"]

|===

During the release process, all BZ's attached to the relevant errata advisories for a particular RHEL release will be closed.  The BZ status is then updated to `CLOSED` and resolution `CURRENT_RELEASE`.  It is at this point that the involvement of the BZ has concluded its responsibilities in relation to RHEL, the RHEL Kernel, and the issues that it addresses.
