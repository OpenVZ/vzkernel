=== GitLab `lab` & Go

The recommended tools (lab) are written in go.  The tools are packaged as RPMs and are available from https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[COPR].  Instructions on installing the RPMs from COPR are provided below.

Users wishing to use a bleeding edge version of lab, must install the widely used go compiler and executable in their environments.

To install `go` in RHEL8 or RHEL9 [Verified Tue Sep 7 2021]:
----
	yum -y install /usr/bin/go # can be installed from AppStream repo
----

To install `go` in Fedora34 [Verified Tue Sep 7 2021]:
----
	yum -y install /usr/bin/go

=== RPM installation

The RPM package is available in a https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/[COPR] repo.  Users must enable the rhkernel-devtools repository to use it through _dnf_:

	dnf copr enable -y bmeneguele/rhkernel-devtools

Users can now install the bichon tool using the default package by executing:

	dnf install -y lab
