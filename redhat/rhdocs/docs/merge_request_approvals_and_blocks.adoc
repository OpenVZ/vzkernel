= Merge Request Approvals and Blocks

Users with sufficient permissions can Approve and Block Merge Requests.  Reviewers should use GitLab’s Approve interface to link:merge_request_approvals_and_blocks.adoc#approving-a-merge-request[Approve Merge requests].  Reviewers can also approve (aka ACK) or block (aka NACK) merge requests by replying to the cover-letter of an email patch series or the patch sent through the email bridge, by adding a comment via the GitLab UI for the merge request, or by using the link:bichon.adoc[bichon] utilities to add a comment to the MR.

== Approving a Merge Request

Reviewers should use GitLab’s Approve interface to approve Merge Requests as this allows the maintainers, managers, and product owners to use the GitLab WebUI or tools to view the approvals for each merge request.

The WebUI has an “Approve” button that is available to users with sufficient permissions to review Merge Requests.  This action can also be completed in lab by executing

or by pressing ‘A’ in bichon in the Merge Request view.
