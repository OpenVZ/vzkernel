#
# RHEL_RELEASE
# -------------
#
# Represents build number in 'release' part of RPM's name-version-release.
#   name is <package_name>, e.g. kernel
#   version is upstream kernel version this kernel is based on, e.g. 4.18.0
#   release is <RHEL_RELEASE>.<dist_tag>[<buildid>], e.g. 100.el8
#

RHEL_RELEASE = 162.18.1

#
# ZSTREAM
# -------
#
#  This variable controls whether we use zstream numbering or not for the
#  package release. The zstream release keeps the build number of the last
#  build done for ystream for the Beta milestone, and increments a second
#  number for each build. The third number is used for branched builds
#  (eg.: for builds with security fixes or hot fixes done outside of the
#  batch release process).
#
#  For example, with ZSTREAM unset or set to "no", all builds will contain
#  a release with only the build number, eg.: kernel-<kernel version>-X.el*,
#  where X is the build number. With ZSTREAM set to "yes", we will have
#  builds with kernel-<kernel version>-X.Y.Z.el*, where X is the last
#  RHEL_RELEASE number before ZSTREAM flag was set to yes, Y will now be the
#  build number and Z will always be 1 except if you're doing a branched build
#  (when you give RHDISTGIT_BRANCH on the command line, in which case the Z
#  number will be incremented instead of the Y).
#
ZSTREAM ?= yes

#
# Early y+1 numbering
# --------------------
#
# In early y+1 process, RHEL_RELEASE consists of 2 numbers: x.y
# First is RHEL_RELEASE inherited/merged from y as-is, second number
# is incremented with each build starting from 1. After merge from y,
# it resets back to 1. This way y+1 nvr reflects status of last merge.
#
# Example:
#
# rhel8.0                        rhel-8.1
#   kernel-4.18.0-58.el8   -->     kernel-4.18.0-58.1.el8
#                                  kernel-4.18.0-58.2.el8
#   kernel-4.18.0-59.el8           kernel-4.18.0-59.1.el8
#   kernel-4.18.0-60.el8
#   kernel-4.18.0-61.el8   -->     kernel-4.18.0-61.1.el8
