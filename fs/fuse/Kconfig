config FUSE_FS
	tristate "FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) support"
	help
	  With FUSE it is possible to implement a fully functional filesystem
	  in a userspace program.

	  There's also a companion library: libfuse2.  This library is available
	  from the FUSE homepage:
	  <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/>
	  although chances are your distribution already has that library
	  installed if you've installed the "fuse" package itself.

	  See <file:Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt> for more information.
	  See <file:Documentation/Changes> for needed library/utility version.

	  If you want to develop a userspace FS, or if you want to use
	  a filesystem based on FUSE, answer Y or M.
